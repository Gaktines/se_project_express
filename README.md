This project is the back end for the What to wear project in which I used MongoDB, Express, and Javascript to create the backend for the project.  Authentication, and Authorization have also been added for the backend.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
